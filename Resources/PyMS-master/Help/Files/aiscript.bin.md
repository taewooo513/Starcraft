# aiscript.bin
`aiscript.bin` contains the AI Scripts used by computers players in melee and campaign maps, as well as for use in map triggers (like "Junkyard Dog"). Because the file has a limit of 65535 bytes, [bwscript.bin](#bwscriptbin) was introduce in BroodWar to allow more scripts to be included.
