# PySPK
PySPK is a tool used for editing the parallax [.spk](/Help/Files/SPK.md) files, which is used for the stars displayed on the Intallation [tileset](/Help/Files/Tilesets/Tilesets.md). PySPK provides an editor to modify the parallax layers, the images available to place on the layers, which images are placed on which layers, as well as a way to export to and import from [.bmp](/Help/Files/BMP.md) files.
