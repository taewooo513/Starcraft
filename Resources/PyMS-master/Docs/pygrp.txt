PyGRP v3.9
PyGRP converts StarCraft GRP files to and from BMP files. It supports compressed and uncompressed GRP's, converting all frames to and from a single BMP file, and reading RLE compressed BMP files.
	Changes	changes
+PyGRP v3.9
 -Save window position
 -Better frame outlines
 -Better uncompressed GRP detection
 -Better listbox handling for up, down, page-up, page-down, etc.
 -Can now import bmps with 256 width and/or height
 -Updated to do atomic writes for all files (writes to a temp file then replaces the existing file with the temp one on completion. Protects your existing files against corruption due to crashes in the writing process)
 -Fixed an error that prevented saving. (Thanks Heinermann)
 -Fixed an error that prevented loading some graphics. (Thanks Heinermann)
 -Fixed an error involving some actions when "Show Preview" was unchecked. (Thanks Heinermann)
 -Fixed several errors for when the user deselects all entries. (Thanks Heinermann)
+PyGRP v3.8
 -Fixed a problem importing frames from a single BMP
+PyGRP v3.7
 -You can now select multiple bmp's to import instead of being stuck with the "same name" mechanic (which PyGRP uses for the command line bmp to grp conversions)
 -Added a "Transparent Index" option (like SFGrpConv) to choose which index in the palette will be used for transparency (can only be changed when a GRP is not open)
 -You no longer need to specify if you are loading an uncompressed grp, only if you are saving to one

 -Opening an uncompressed GRP now warns you to use the "Save Uncompressed" option when saving

 -Added a function to move all selected frames Up or Down through the list
+PyGRP v3.5
 -Fixed a compiling problem resulting from having more then 127 index 0 pixels in a row

	Commandline Options	cmdline
[
-h	--help	Display the command line format and options with small descriptions.
-p <pal>	--palette <pal>	Tells the program to use the palette <pal> from the Palettes folder (The file name can but doesn't need to have the ".pal" extension), and be wrapped in quotes if it contains spaces.	units.pal
-g	--grptobmp	Tells the program you want to convert from GRP to BMP. This will make <inp> be the GRP file, and [out] will be the name used for the BMP's. When the BMP's are saved they will be "[out] ###.bmp" where ### is the frame number zero padded to the left (so 1 would be 001). If [out] is not supplied it will use the file name of the <inp> file.	
-b	--bmptogrp	Tells the program you want to convert a list of BMP's to a GRP. This will make <inp> be the first BMP in the frame list, and [out] will be the GRP file. The BMP files should be formatted like "name ***.bmp", where name is a name, and *** is the frame number (so frame 0 of "marine.grp" could be "marine 000.bmp" or "marine 0.bmp"). If [out] is not supplied it will use the name part of the BMP files as the GRP file name (frame number not included).
-u	--grpuncompress	Tells the program you want the GRP used to be uncompressed (used both when converting from GRP to BMP's, or BMP's to GRP). Most GRP files are supposed to be compressed, but StarCraft sometimes needs them to be uncompressed (for example the grp 'game\icons.grp'). If your GRP wont convert to BMP's, try using this option. If your GRP only converts with this option, remember to convert the BMP's back with this option.
	--gui	Opens a file with the GUI
]
	Example Usage	examples
Here is an example of converting marine.grp to a bmp, then back to a grp:
<Command Line
python PyGRP.pyw marine.grp
   ..edit images..
python PyGRP.pyw -b "marine 000.grp"
>

Some GRP's are uncompressed, for example 'game\icons.grp':
<Command Line
python PyGRP.pyw -u "C:\Program Files\StarCraft\My Mod\mpq\game\icons.grp" myicons
   ..edit images..
python PyGRP.pyw -u -b "C:\Program Files\StarCraft\My Mod\mpq\game\myicons 000.bmp" icons
>

The default palette is 'units.pal'. If you are converting something that uses another palette, like Dark Swarm, you would do something like:
<Command Line
python PyGRP.pyw -p gfire.pal Project\dswarm.grp
   ..edit images..
python PyGRP.pyw -p gfire.pal -b "Project\dswarm 000.bmp"
>
